# Design-of-bandpass-filters-based-on-TE201-rectangular-cavities
Software in Python to perform the design along with HFSS simulation results for the iris structures. This dataset and software refer to the filter design example (cascaded triplet topology) of the journal article with DOI: 10.1109/TMTT.2025.3567729.

The best candidate selection is run first. Once identified the best combination of irises, their corresponding IDs are indicated in the second Python script (refinement stage). Finally, run this second script to obtain the designed cavity.
